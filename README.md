## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wasn't sure what the best approach was for showing the icon with faded background over the existing image on hover. A quick search of W3 Schools Image Styling page got me on the right track.

### Continued development

To be used in a production environment, changes would need to be made to componentize the html and css to limit any unintentional interference with existing code. 

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools Image Hover Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - I replicated this code structure and css styling for use with the image hover style.
- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Still the best reference for when you're not sure if it's align-items or align-content.
